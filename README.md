# python-homework-05-API submission for Erik Prieto 
#MCFinancial Tools uploaded as unsure if required for grading
#Overall I think I completed the assignment as intended - I liked the challenge of working with nested dictionaries in the first API pull. 
#I noticed in Overstack that they leveraged loops to get a flattened dictionary but I opted for a simpler route.
